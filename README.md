## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for watching this front-end coding challenge and its solution.



**To complete this challenge, you need a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to develop a calculator app and make it look as close as possible to the design and add the functionality.


Your users should be able to:

- See how the size of elements adjusts based on your device's screen size.
- Perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- Adjust the color theme according to your preferences.


## Solution!
For the development of this app I used javascript, html and css, I supported 100% in the manipulation of the DOM and responsive styles for the different views.
